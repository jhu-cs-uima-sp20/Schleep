alarm app

Description for Assignment t4A
Currently we open up to the home screen with the correct formatting. We can add a task using the FAB in the bottom right corner, or enter the settings activity in the right top corner (contents not yet implemented). When creating an alarm, you can set the time and the name. The other features are not yet implemented. You can either save the alarm to create it, or delete to go back. The alarm will then be shown in the recyclerview on the home screen. You can edit the alarms by simply clicking on them, and then press save/delete to save or delete them.
